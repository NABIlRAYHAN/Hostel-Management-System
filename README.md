# Hostel-Management-System
I have developed a hostel management system that will help the authority and also student to improve the quality of hostel room booking system. When staying away from home, a hostel is nothing less than a home forstudents. It is located on the university grounds and provides spacious, well-ventilated dorms as well as single rooms.


The aim of this project is to develop a simple, effective & convenient Management System to
provide selected decision-oriented information needed by management to serve, observe, control
and evaluate the activities of the student by their room number. It is designed within a framework
that emphasizes on the studentâ€™ room information, booking & billing easily. Our program will
allow the management to keep student details safe and secure, easily handle customer's records
and billing system and provide the best service.
